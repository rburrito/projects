        <ol>
          <li><b>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</b>
            <br> Although Buffy came out almost 20 years ago, it remains one of the most progressive shows of its time. It provided a good mix of action, romance, comedy, and mystery. I admit that some seasons are much better than others, but Joss Whedon
            managed to create a satisfactory ending to the final season. Click <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer" class="info-link" target="_blank">here </a>to read Buffy's Wiki page.<br><button class="target btn btn-primary like">Like Buffy</button></li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Firefly</b>
            <br>I had a hard time getting into the show until the end of the second episode. By the time I got to "Our Mrs. Reynolds", I was completely hooked and had to go back to rewatch all the witty lines I missed in the first few episodes. I definitely
            enjoyed watching Gina Torres, Summer Glau, and Nathan Fillion. Unfortunately, it ended with only 11 episodes. Click <a href="http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/Firefly" class="info-link" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more on the Firefly Wiki.

          <br>
          <li><b>Charmed</b>
            <br>Although the last few seasons left more to be desired, I really enjoyed the first four seasons, especially the beginning of Piper and Leo's romance. Season five is still tolerable, but the inconsistencies of the later seasons were a little
            annoying. Read the <a href="http://charmed.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="info-link" target="_blank">Charmed Wiki</a> for more.
            <br><button class="target btn btn-primary like">Like Charmed</button></li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Fringe</b>
            <br>Fringe brings my imagination to life as the parallel world reminds me just a bit of The Man in the High Castle. I really enjoyed the what-ifs and the slight character changes brought on by the different circumstances each character experiences.
            I loved the entire cast, but the standout actor is clearly John Noble. Find out more about the characters on the <a href="http://fringe.wikia.com/wiki/FringeWiki" class="info-link" target="_blank">Fringe Wiki</a>.

          <br>
          <li><b>Alphas</b>
            <br>Alphas is what Heroes should have been. It took me some time, but I grew to love the characters as the season went on. I think I was more drawn to the science-y aspect of this show. Unfortunately, this show was canceled right when it found
            its momentum. Click <a href="http://alphas.wikia.com/wiki/Alphas_Wiki" class="info-link" target="_blank">here</a> to go to the Alphas Wiki.

          <br>
          <li><b>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</b>
            <br>To be honest, I started watching this show because Summer Glau was in it. While I enjoyed her performance as Cameron Phillips, John Connor's most trusted reprogrammed Terminator, I was blown away by Garrett Dillahunt as Cromartie and later
            as John Henry. I could not believe he was the goofy grandfather in Raising Hope. Of course, the show did not get enough viewers and was prematurely canceled. Read more on the <a href="http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles"

          <br>
          <li><b>Orphan Black</b>
            <br>This is a relatively new series compared to the rest of the shows on this list. Tatiana Maslany plays countless characters in this thrilling clone conspiracy. I am continually amazed by her acting chops and the range of characters she
            is required to play. The show does have a ridiculously convoluted storyline making it difficult to keep track of all the events that happened. However, I continue to look forward to every season because I have already fallen in love with the
            characters to turn back now. For more information, visit the <a href="http://orphanblack.wikia.com/wiki/Orphan_Black_Wiki" class="info-link" target="blank">Orphan Black Wiki</a>.
