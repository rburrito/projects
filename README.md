# projects

A collection of front-end and back-end projects I completed while following the freeCodeCamp curriculum. The front-end projects use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery while the backend projects are built in Node.js using Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and some npm packages. Note: The freeCodeCamp curriculum was recently rebooted, and the user stories I fulfilled for the front-end projects are different from current assignment links, but the links to the assignments give you an idea of what was required.

Tribute Page Project:
My first coding project was to create a responsive tribute page using the Bootstrap, jQuery, and Animate.css libraries and fulfilling user stories as directed on freeCodeCamp.

JSON API Projects:
These projects integrated data retrieved from JSON APIs to create the following projects using Boostrap and jQuery: random quote generator, local weather app, wikipedia viewer, and Twitch API streamer.

Vanilla JavaScript Projects:
I created a responsive calculator, pomodoro clock, tic tac toe game, and Simon game using HTML, CSS Flexbox, and vanilla JavaScript. The calculator was the first project I made which used CSS Flexbox. The pomodoro clock helped me learn the concept of measuring different states.
